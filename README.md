# Justin Koebele Photo

### About
I built [Justin Koebele Photo](http://www.justinkoebelephoto.com/) for my buddy Justin. I had already made [Fredducation](https://www.fredducation.co/) and knew where to begin with creating a website. I learned a ton from making my language learning blog and took those lessons to this project. Justin wanted a place to show off his photography without using social media apps, which is something that resonated with me. This website is something we are proud of and hope you enjoy.  

### How was the site built?
For those that are curious as to how I made it or how one can make a 
similar site using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), we've made the code available to all. **Below is a nonexhaustive list of tools used to build the site.** 

- Django Python Web Framework
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5 CSS Framework
- JavaScript
- Amazon Relational Database Service (AWS RDS) provided PostrgreSQL database.
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) for serving static assests.  
- Amazon Simple Email Service (AWS SES) for sending out a newsletter and receiving user sumbitted contact information.
- Heroku Cloud Platform for deployment.

The main resource leaned on for builidng a basic understanding of Django was [this YouTube playlist by CodingEntrepreneurs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEsfXFp6DpzRMby_cSoWTFw8zaMdTEXgL&si=_ePrR3U87arvJmvQ). From there, [Fredducation](https://www.fredducation.co/) was built and from that a better understanding of the tools was acquired. Taking lessons from Fredducation, I began building JK Photo to fit Justin's wants and needs.
