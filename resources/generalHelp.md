`source Scripts/activate`

- This activates the virtual environment on your PC (Justin's PC). This must 
be done everytime you open VS Code. It doesn't hurt if you do it more than once. 
The app will not run without this being done and an error related to it not be activated 
is a ModuleNotFoundError. 

`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` 

- Installs all package needed for the app to run.
