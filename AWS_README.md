# Amazon Web Services (AWS) Help and Concepts Explained

## AWS S3
- AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) is a cloud storage serivce we are using to serve **_static files_** to those requesting our webpage from the server. From the (Django Documentation)[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial06/#:~:text=Aside%20from%20the%20HTML%20generated,files%20as%20%E2%80%9Cstatic%20files%E2%80%9D.], here is an explanation of what static files are: "_Aside from the HTML generated by the server, web applications generally need to serve additional files — such as images, JavaScript, or CSS — necessary to render the complete web page. In Django, we refer to these files as “static files”._" We use this because it optimizes the delivery of these files to the clinet requesting to see the webpage and also frees up space we cant spare in out code repository.
